Hello, this is a sample carrier file. We will use this file to demonstrate the process of steganography, where we hide a secret message within another file. This text continues to ensure we have enough data to embed the entire message without any issues. Keep reading this meaningless text that serves to fill space and provide enough buffer for message embedding. Thank you for reading this far; your curiosity is appreciated!
